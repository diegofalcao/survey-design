# survey-design

This project uses the Ford Fulkerson method to discover a max flow in a network flow constructed by reading the amazon-meta.txt dataset. The program receives as the input the percent to be applied to each client which indicates how many surveys each user is willing to answer and produces as output the percentage that indicates the maximum amount of surveys each product can receive.
